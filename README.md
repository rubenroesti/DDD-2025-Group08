## [Project title] Trillullì

### Data Collection
- Where did you get your data from? [source/s link]
The project uses a collection of publicly accessible scientific datasets on the Osiris REx missions of sample gathering on the Bennu asteroid as well as other publicly accessible aminoacid analysis on other asteroids such as Ryugu or the less recent, fallen on earth, Murchison. The datasets were merged into one, simplified dataset for comparison specifically on amino acids and amines. 
A nature paper was also considered and served as a source of complex scientific data analysis.
* (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02472-9)
* Public archives containing documented sightings, signal logs, and descriptions of unusual transmissions, usually provided as PDF files or structured text.
* Space-related audio material, such as intercepted radiofrequencies and sound tracks from SETI, stored as WAV or MP3 files.
These sources offer written accounts, screenshots, and audio evidence that together outline how people interpret or describe possible extra-terrestrial messages.
