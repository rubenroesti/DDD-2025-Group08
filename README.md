### Abstract (300 charachters)
This project investigates how people claim to communicate with alien species by gathering posts, reports, and shared experiences from online communities and public archives. The material was organized, coded, and grouped to uncover repeating themes and moments of collective attention. To make the findings clearer, the grouped data was transformed into timelines and location-based views that show when and where the conversations intensified. The highlights point to shared narratives appearing across different communities, synchronized waves of reported signals, and recurring ideas about how contact might take place.

### What topic does the project address?
The project explores how humans interpret, imagine, and report communication with extra-terrestrial species. It looks at the stories, signals, and cultural references that shape our idea of what contact might look like, and how different communities describe their attempts to understand messages they believe come from beyond Earth.

### What data have you considered?
[Delete this for final delivery] *Specify the format and sources. Use also images/screenshots to describe your dataset.*

The project considers a mix of publicly accessible material related to claimed human–alien communication. The dataset includes:
* Online posts and reports collected from open communities, shared in text or image format.
* Public archives containing documented sightings, signal logs, and descriptions of unusual transmissions, usually provided as PDF files or structured text.
* Space-related audio material, such as intercepted radiofrequencies and sound tracks from SETI, stored as WAV or MP3 files.
These sources offer written accounts, screenshots, and audio evidence that together outline how people interpret or describe possible extra-terrestrial messages.

### What does the visualisation show?
[Delete this for final delivery] *List three key insights emerging from your visualisation.*

-	Recurring narrative patterns:
Different communities describe similar types of signals and “messages,” suggesting shared storytelling elements across platforms.
-	Moments of collective attention:
Peaks of reported signals and posts tend to appear in synchronized waves, often clustered around the same dates or events.
-	Geographical convergence:
Several reports originate from recurring locations or regions, pointing to zones where conversations about possible contact intensify more frequently.
